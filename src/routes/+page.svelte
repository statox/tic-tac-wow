<p>This is my Tic Tac Toe based games playground</p>

<p>
    Try <a href="/tictaccup">Tic Tac Cup</a> a tic tac toe game with pieces of different dimensions.
    You can play against different level of AIs.
</p>

<p>
    On <a href="/runner">the runner page</a> you can simulate several games of tic tac cup with different
    AIs playing against each other
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="/tictactoe">Tic Tac Toe</a> page is unsurprisingly a classical tic tac toe game.

    I'm getting inspiration from
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe_variants" target="noopener">
        this wiki page
    </a>.
