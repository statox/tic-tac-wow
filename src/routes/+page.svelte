    <a href="/tictaccup">Tic Tac Cup</a> is a tic tac toe game with pieces of different dimensions,
    inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobblet" target="noopener">Gobblet</a>
    In the "Game" section you can play against different level of AIs. The "Runner" section allows to
    make the AIs play games against each other and get statistics of these games.

<p>
    The <a href="/tictactoe2">Tic Tac Toe 2</a> page is more interesting as this is a complete tic tac
    toe implementation with different set of AIs and a "Runner" section to benchmark the AIs against
    each other. a random AI.
