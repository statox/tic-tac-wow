<p>This is my Tic Tac Toe based games playground</p>

<h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>
<p>The <a href="/tictactoe">Tic Tac Toe</a> page is a implementation of the classical Tic Tac Toe game.
    The &quot;Game&quot; section allows a player to play against different AI opponent. Buttons also allow the
    player to use one of the AIs to play their move.
</p>
<ul><li><b>random</b> is a dumb AI where the next move is chosen randomly amongst the valid moves
    </li>
    <li><b>hardcodedrules</b> is a strategy based on
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#Strategy" target="noopener">Newell and Simon&#39;s 1972 tic-tac-toe program
        </a> as described on Wikipedia. This version does not look for move creating forks or blocking
        the opponent&#39;s forks making it easy to beat.
    </li>
    <li><b>hardcodedrulesComplete</b> is based on the previous strategy but it also checks for forks
        and try to block opponent&#39;s fork. However my implementation of this last check is not complete
        and thus the AI is not perfect, it can lose some games.
    </li>
    <li><b>minmax</b> is an implementation of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">the minmax algorith</a> is according to my tests
        it is a perfect opponent which never loses.
    </li></ul>

<p>The &quot;Generator&quot; section can be used to make the AIs play several games against each other. The
    interesting use case is to compare the performances of the different AIs against a random
    player. This is by this means that I empirically determined that my hard coded rules strategies
    are not perfect unlike my minmax strategy.
</p>

<p>The &quot;Analyzer&quot; section is used for debugging and writting tests. It allows the users to create
    any tic tac toe board and visualize some information like the bynary representation of each
    player&#39;s move
</p>

<h2>Gobblet</h2>
<p><a href="/gobblet">Gobblet</a> is a tic tac toe game with pieces of different dimensions,
    inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobblet" target="noopener">Gobblet</a> played
    on a 3x3 board. Players take turns to place a piece on the board or move their piece that already
    is on the board. Bigger pieces can be placed so that they cover smaller ones and a player wins by
    aligning 3 pieces.
</p>
<p>In the &quot;Game&quot; section you can play against different level of AIs. None of them are perfect.
    Buttons allow the player to use one of the AIs to play their move.
</p>
<ul><li><b>random</b> is a simple random AI which choose one of the possible moves.</li>
    <li><b>win_or_random</b> Checks all the possible moves it can do, if one of them creates a win for
        the AI then it plays it otherwise it plays a random move amongst the possible ones.
    </li>
    <li><b>euristic</b> makes a very simple choice based on the euristic value of the next move.
        <ul><li>For the current state compute all the possible moves.</li>
            <li>Score each move with a euristic</li>
            <li>Select the move with the highest score</li></ul>
        This strategy is not very good because it doesn&#39;t consider the future It will only play a winning
        move if one is possible. Since it doesn&#39;t check the next opponent&#39;s move it sometimes play losing
        moves. However since the euristic favorise more interesting cells (center and corners) it is
        a bit better than the win_or_random strat
    </li>
    <li><b>minmax</b> is a classical minmax strategy. No pruning is implemented so the max depth is set
        to 2 because for higher depths the response time gets quite long.
    </li>
    <li><b>negamax</b> is an implementation of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax" target="noopener">negamax algorithm</a>. As
        expected it yields the same results as the minmax strategy but its code is simpler. The
        performance remains the same as minmax with the same max depth.
    </li>
    <li><b>alphabeta</b></li>
    is an incomplete
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning" target="noopener">minmax with alphabeta pruning strategy
    </a>. Here the children are not ordered via an evaluation fonction, the children are ordered in
    a consistent but random order. That makes the alpha-beta pruning unefficient and it only improve
    the performance to allow a depth of 3.
    <li><b>alphabeta_with_order</b> aims to fix the previous solution by ordering the children depending
        on a score attributed by a custom evaluation function. However the implementation is incomplete
        and probably buggy so the AI is not perfect.
    </li></ul>
<p>The &quot;Runner&quot; section allows to make the AIs play games against each other and get statistics of
    these games.
</p>

<h2>Misere</h2>

<p>The <a href="/misere">Misere</a> page a variant of Tic Tac Toe where the player wins if the opponent
    aligns 3 pieces. The &quot;Game&quot; section allows a player to play against different AI opponent. Only the
    random and minmax are implemented because they reused the code of the regular Tic Tac Toe AI.
